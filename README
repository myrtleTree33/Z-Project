@Project 	: The Z Project
@Descr 		: This Arduino-based project is developed as an airship, known as a blimp.  It is uses 2 Arduinos, a wireless Xbee connection and can be loaded with addition sensors (in addition to the 2 sonar sensors on board).  The communication protocol has been designed in such a way to maximize communication using a minimal transfer of data.  Wireless non-blocking serial communication has been abstracted as "strings" (aka "sentences") rather than bits and bytes.  This enables one to "talk" to the blimp in terms of sentences, rather than fixed-length raw bytes.

DEPENDENCIES:
	| Arduino-C Code
		- Libraries
			- String-Serial (https://github.com/toiletfreak/String-Serial)
			- L293D driver library (https://github.com/toiletfreak/L293D)
		
	| PCB, Schematic, Prototyping layouts
		- Fritzing (http://fritzing.org/)
		

INSTRUCTIONS:
	- Construct the Blimp transmitter and receiver in accordance to given schematic (Tx and Rx).
	- Upload relevant Arduino-C program to Tx and Rx.  Uncomment definitions in code, as necessary.
	- Turn on the Blimp.
	- Connect transmitter to computer.
	- Connect to the transmitter using terminal or a relevant Serial interface program at 9600 baud.  If you are using a UNIX-based system such as Linux, I recommend using 'screen'.  e.g. 'screen /dev/ttyACM0 9600'
	- Commands are as follow:
		- 'q,w,e,a,s,d,z,x,c'	- controls direction of blimp motor thrusters.
		- 'p'			- print status and sensor information of blimp
		- '[,]'			- switch elevator rotor on / off
		
PORTING:
	- It should be easy to adapt the Blimp schematics and code to a similarily-designed land / water based vehicle using a suitable replacement of parts.
